Investment professional by experience, full-stack builder by calling. After some years on the investment floor, I realized I was spending more time chasing IT and operational risks than alpha â€” so I switched gears. Now, I chase runtime errors like I used to chase market moves. I hate ugly code and messy architecturesâ€”Iâ€™ve seen what that leads to firsthand.

Most of my work is private (not mysterious, just not built for broad release), but Iâ€™m determined to share more over time. If you landed here, you probably already know more about my workâ€”or why I sent you the link. Not exactly a page you stumble upon by accident! ðŸ˜„

Always open to chat, demo projects, or collaborate. Pull requests on my open repos? Absolutely welcome!


Looking forward to connectingâ€”just say hi!
