# Glad you’re here — let’s dive in 🚀

Investment professional by experience, full-stack builder by calling. After years on the investment floor, I realized I was spending more time chasing IT and operational risks than alpha — so I switched gears. Now, I chase runtime errors like I used to chase market moves. I hate ugly code and messy architectures—I’ve seen what that leads to firsthand.

Most of my work is private (not mysterious, just not built for broad release), but I’m determined to share more over time. If you landed here, you probably already know more about my work—or why I sent you the link. Not exactly a page you stumble upon by accident! 😄

Always open to chat, demo projects, or collaborate. Pull requests on my open repos? Absolutely welcome!
